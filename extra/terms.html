        <p>All notices / communications shall be given to us either by post to our Premises (see address above) or by

          at any time before 14 days have passed from the day after the contract was made. If, however, we have started
          to perform our side of the contract before you exercise your right to cancel, then the right to cancel is
          lost.</p>
